# myPracticeProblems

This is a repo of my answers to coding questions from LeetCode, HackerRank, and Project Euler. Currently, I am only working through these in either Java (my strongest language) or Python 3 (because I want to improve), depending on the problem and my capabilities. But, in the future, I may decide to proviide additional solutions in other coding languages like C#, etc.

If you wish to collaborate, or possibly help me out with something, I would only request that you place your modified code in a comment in the file instead of modifying my code directly.

Navigating the directory should be fairly intuitive. But, if I do decide to code these problems in multiple languages, the directory structure could change to something like this:

* HackerRank
  * Java
  * Python
  * C#
* LeetCode
  * Java
  * Python
  * C#
* Project Euler
  * Java
  * Python
  * C#
 
That's all for now! If you have any questions, please feel free to message me!

EDIT: Some of these may have test cases written into the code, and some may not. They were just for my benefit; you're free to create your own or ignore them as you see fit.
