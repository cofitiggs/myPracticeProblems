# myPracticeProblems

This is a repo of my answers to coding questions from LeetCode, HackerRank, and Project Euler. Currently, I am only working these with either Java (my strongest language) or Python 3 (because I want to improve), depending on the problem and my capabilities. But, in the future, I may decide to proviide additional solutions in other coding languages like C#, etc.

The folder names are subject to change, but the general directory structure should be something similar to:

Complete:
  * HackerRank
  * LeetCode
  * Project Euler

Incomplete:
  * HackerRank
  * LeetCode
  * Project Euler

If I do decide to code these problems in multiple languages, the directory structure could change to something like this:

Complete:
  * HackerRank
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#
  * LeetCode
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#
  * Project Euler
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#

Incomplete:
  * HackerRank
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#
  * LeetCode
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#
  * Project Euler
     * Java
     * Python
     * C#
   
That's all for now!
